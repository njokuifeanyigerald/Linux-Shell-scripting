# for learning linux shell scripting

before we start writing in a shell file, we use the c-ban symbol which is `#!/bin/bash` to tell the Linux system to use this shell..

**to start sh the file do**
```sh
sh learn.sh
```
The shell script is a read or write file, inorder to make the file an executable file.
```sh
chmod u+x learn.sh
```
